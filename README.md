## Hi there 👋  

My name is Allan, and I'm currently finishing my third year of **Computer Science** at TMU.  

I'm aspiring to become a **software engineer** in the future, though I know there's still a lot to learn along the way.  

### Here's what I already know:  
- **Java** ☕  
- **Python** 🐍  
- **Docker** 🐳  
- **HTML** 🌐  
- **CSS** 🎨  
- **JavaScript** ✨  
- **React** ⚛️
- **SQL** 🗄️
- **REST APIs** 🔗  

I'm currently working on learning Next.js, and then I will build a full-stack web application to help students at TMU choose their course paths!
